# Common programming paradigms include:[1][2][3] 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm

## 1. "Imperative": in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
    - a. 'Procedural': which groups instructions into procedures,
    - b. 'Object-oriented': which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,

## 2. "Declarative": in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
  - a.'Functional': in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
  - b.'Logic':  in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
  - c. 'Mathematical': in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
